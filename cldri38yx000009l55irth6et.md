# Task Details

The system admin team of xFusionCorp Industries has noticed an issue with some servers in Stratos Datacenter where some servers are not in sync w.r.t time. Because of this, several application functionalities have been impacted. To fix this issue the team has started using common/standard NTP servers. They are finished with most of the servers except App Server 1. Therefore, perform the following tasks on this server:

Install and configure the NTP server on App Server 1.

Add NTP server 1.sg.pool.ntp.org in NTP configuration on App Server 1.

Please do not try to start/restart/stop ntp service, as we already have a restart for this service scheduled for tonight and we don't want these changes to be applied right now.

> Perform the below commands based on your question server, user name & other details might differ. So please read the task carefully before executing it. All the Best üëç

# **Solution:**

| **Server Name** | **IP** | **Hostname** | **User** | **Password** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| stapp01 | 172.16.238.10 | stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com | tony | Ir0nM@n | Nautilus App 1 |
| stapp02 | 172.16.238.11 | stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com | steve | Am3ric@ | Nautilus App 2 |
| stapp03 | 172.16.238.12 | stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com | banner | BigGr33n | Nautilus App 3 |

## 1\. Log in on the App server as per the task

```plaintext
thor@jump_host ~$ ssh tony@stapp01

The authenticity of host 'stapp01 (172.16.238.10)' can't be established.

ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:2DbVbI7xvrQSSIOQD502dx7BHfADaJEecTxNIX/MmQs.

ECDSA key fingerprint is MD5:c6:8e:51:2e:28:dd:bd:cc:e4:b6:b5:c4:d3:dc:13:e6.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

Warning: Permanently added 'stapp01,172.16.238.10' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

tony@stapp01's password:

 [tony@stapp01 ~]$ sudo su -

 We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System

Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

     #1) Respect the privacy of others.

    #2) Think before you type.

    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

 [sudo] password for tony:

[root@stapp01 ~]#
```

> A brief description of the commands "ssh" and "sudo su-" is given in Essential [Linux Commands](https://ikunalsingh.hashnode.dev/introduction-to-essential-linux-commands)

## 2\. Check NTP is installed, if not then install it on the server

```plaintext
[root@stapp01 ~]# rpm -qa |grep ntp

[root@stapp01 ~]#

[root@stapp01 ~]# yum install -y ntp

## rpm -qa | grep ntp

The "rpm -qa | grep ntp" is used to search the RPM database for any packages that contain the string "ntp". The "rpm -qa" command lists all installed packages on the system, and the "grep ntp" part filters the output to only show packages that have "ntp" in their name or description. The result is a list of all installed NTP (Network Time Protocol) packages.

# 3\. Confirm package install successfully

```plaintext
[root@stapp01 ~]# rpm -qa |grep ntp

ntp-4.2.6p5-29.el7.centos.2.x86_64

ntpdate-4.2.6p5-29.el7.centos.2.x86_64

[root@stapp01 ~]#
```

## 4\. Add the NTP¬†server to the configuration¬†file

```plaintext
[root@stapp01 ~]# vi /etc/ntp.conf

[root@stapp01 ~]#

[root@stapp01 ~]# cat /etc/ntp.conf |grep sg.pool

server 1.sg.pool.ntp.org

[root@stapp01 ~]#
```

## 5\. Check¬†the NTP¬†daemon status

```plaintext
[root@stapp01 ~]# ntpstat

Unable to talk to NTP daemon. Is it running?

[root@stapp01 ~]#

  [root@stapp01 ~]# systemctl status ntpd

‚óè ntpd.service - Network Time Service

   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/ntpd.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)

   Active: inactive (dead)
```

## 6\. Start the NTP daemon enable and check the status

```plaintext
[root@stapp01 ~]# systemctl enable ntpd

Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/ntpd.service to /usr/lib/systemd/system/ntpd.service.

[root@stapp01 ~]# systemctl start  ntpd

[root@stapp01 ~]#

[root@stapp01 ~]# systemctl status ntpd

‚óè ntpd.service - Network Time Service

   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/ntpd.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)

   Active: active (running) since Sun 2021-06-20 10:40:05 UTC; 4s ago

  Process: 1151 ExecStart=/usr/sbin/ntpd -u ntp:ntp $OPTIONS (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)

 Main PID: 1152 (ntpd)

   CGroup: /docker/dc4d87bd2c999a9987e26698b929f742c010e3ec3a5e69c4c92a08017662753a/system.slice/ntpd.service

           ‚îî‚îÄ1152 /usr/sbin/ntpd -u ntp:ntp -g 

Hint: Some lines were ellipsized, use -l to show in full.

[root@stapp01 ~]#
```

## 7\. Validate the task by¬†NTP¬†status

```plaintext
[root@stapp01 ~]# ntpstat

synchronised to NTP server (66.85.78.80) at stratum 3

   time correct to within 235 ms

   polling server every 64 s

[root@stapp01 ~]#
```
